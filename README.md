This report was for a final project in an undergraduate computer graphics 
course at the University of Texas at Austin. The final project was open-ended 
and I chose to extend a previous ray tracer assignment with simulated reflective 
diffraction grating. A C++ ray tracer framework was provided by the course, 
then completed and extended by me. The ray tracer code remains private to prevent 
scholastic dishonesty by future students who may stumble upon my project. This 
report only shows the results of my efforts.
